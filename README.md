# Alice In Web3land
Notes about web3


> Alice looked round her in great surprise. ‘Why, I do believe we’ve been under this tree the whole time! Everything’s just as it was!’
> ‘Of course it is,’ said the Queen, ‘what would you have it?’
> ‘Well, in our country,’ said Alice, still panting a little, ‘you’d generally get to somewhere else — if you ran very fast for a long time, as we’ve been doing.’
> ‘A slow sort of country!’ said the Queen. ‘Now, here, you see, it takes all the running you can do, to keep in the same place.
> If you want to get somewhere else, you must run at least twice as fast as that!’
> *Through the Looking Glass* Lewis Carroll
