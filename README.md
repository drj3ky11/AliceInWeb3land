# Alice In Web3land



> Alice looked round her in great surprise. ‘Why, I do believe we’ve been under this tree the whole time! Everything’s just as it was!’
> ‘Of course it is,’ said the Queen, ‘what would you have it?’
> ‘Well, in our country,’ said Alice, still panting a little, ‘you’d generally get to somewhere else — if you ran very fast for a long time, as we’ve been doing.’
> ‘A slow sort of country!’ said the Queen. ‘Now, here, you see, it takes all the running you can do, to keep in the same place.
> If you want to get somewhere else, you must run at least twice as fast as that!’

In web3, within a single transaction you can host hundreds of events. But at the end of the block, everything is the same as before, or maybe not everything? Front-runners, flash loans... and their operations on the "memory" that has not yet been, are some of the most "singular" actors of the mempool. 

The creation of new protocols and smart contracts is a daily race in the web3 environment.The activity and speed of interaction is dizzying. The meticulous and specialized analysis, the cooperation of the community and the community and understanding among the various players is the only way that such a new technology can be is the only way for such a novel technology to be truly successful and secure.
